Personal website at https://jfcrenshaw.github.io

Design based on the [Strata HTML5 template](https://html5up.net/strata).
Academic icons from [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/).

Website scales and adapts well to screen size.

`assets/cv.pdf` is automatically pushed by my cv repo everytime it is updated (using the copcat github action).
